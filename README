Git by Proxy
============

== Description

Simple rake tasks to rope in a graphic designer who doesn't want to use version control and (S)FTP's stuff up to the server instead, usually the public and views folders. Includes multi environment deployment.

Made to scratch my own itch.

== Installation ==

git clone git://github.com/krisleech/Git-By-Proxy.git vendor/plugins/git_by_proxy

== Assumptions ==

You login in to the server with a ssh key
Your using git and mod_rails
Tested on Mac (client) and Ubuntu (server), but should work on any UNIX

== Getting Started ==

Create deploy.yml in 'config' folder with server_environment settings (see example)
rake server:setup
rake server:deploy 

NB: It would be wise to set 'pretend' to true and see what commands will be executed before running this on a live server

== Other tasks/examples ==

rake server:setup RAILS_ENV=production
rake server:deploy RAILS_ENV=production
rake server:get_ui 
rake server:restart_app (assumes passenger)
rake server:update_code

== Todo ==

Can this be done better, please fork/suggest...
Better name/description
Extract more in to deploy.yml for configurability
Add a symlinked shared folder of non-versioned files (eg. user uploads)
Compress 'teardowns'
Add cleanup task to remove old 'teardowns'
Teardown should really teardown, and we should have separate 'backup' task
Is there a way to automatically run 'server_environment' dependancy...
Add logging on client and server side
